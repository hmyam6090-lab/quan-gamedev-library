# 🎮 Quan’s Game Development Toolbox

Hi! I’m **Quan** 👋  
I like cats and I like making video games.

This repository is my **personal game dev toolbox** (mostly in godot for now):  
a growing collection of scripts, mechanics, systems, and experiments that I document along the way for **learning, reuse, and future projects**.

Think of it as:

> **Notes to my future self, but also public since I'm performative like that**

You’re welcome to explore, learn from/shit on, and use anything here (or you can just look my cats below...)

If you wanna get straight to work, consider checking out [**`Release Notes`**](release-notes.md) or [**`Project Structure`**](structure.md)

If it's your first time here, check out [_`User Guide`_](guide.md)
